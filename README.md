the code that i created outputs text to the console and it consists of a single class which is called main1 and i use system.out.println to display the message hello world. it doesnt require any user input and was tested by the running the program and showing the result the correct result in the console

i developed this program so that a user can enter their name and then receive a greeting in the console and i used the scanner class to read input from the keyboard and store the users name in a string variable. During making the code i encountered some sytax errors such as using hashtag for comments and case senstivity whern using System.out statement which were shown through testing. After i fixed these issues the program worked correctly and i used the input name youshush to confirm that the greeting displayed correctly.

I made this program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle and display it based on what the user inputed. I used the scanner class to allow the user to enter the detials for the rectangle which was stored as a double so it would allow for decimal values. I enountered sytax errors such as missing brackers in the main metrhod and i forgot to add import for the scanner class which prevented it from working. I then fixed these and it successfully displayed the correct area and perimeter.

i made this program to calculate and show the average of two numbers entered from the user. i used the scanner class to read the inputs and stored them into double variables to allow for decimal numbers to be used. I did the average by adding the two numbers together and then dividing it by two. I tested it by using whole numbers and decimal numbers and it worked.

This program allows the user to input 2 integers and then display them in the original order and then it swaps the order. The values are stored in a int variable and a temporary variable is used to store the value of the first integer which prevents data from being lost. the program then outputs the swapped order to show the program worked.

I created that makes the user enter their age and shows the year that they were born. I used to the scanner class to read what the user inputed and asked for their age with the nextInt() method. Then i created another variable called current year where you get the local.date class and the year of birth is used bu subtracting the current year from the age. I tested this by putting in the age 23 and it outputted that the birth year was 2003 which is correct

Ive made this program to make the user enter their full date of birth by providing the day, month and year as sepearted inputs. They are read by the scanner class and are then used to create a localdate object which represents the users date of birth. The current date is obtained using local.date.now() and the number of days which is caluclated between the date of birth and today is done by the chrono.unit.days.between() method. As i was doing this i encoutered a synax error which was on the int day line where i put a dash instead of an equal sign. I corrected this and then the program worked as i inputted the dates and it showed how many days old i am.

Ive made this program to convert feet into miles and i used the scanner class to read the users input and store it as a double value so it allows for decimal numbers. I used the conversion by dividing feet by 5280 to get the answer. The answer is displayed to the user and initialy i made a syntax error by forgetting to capitalise the S for scanner but once i fixed that the program worked. I tested it with the value shared in the screenshot and it worked.
